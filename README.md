## Description 📝

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features from the breast cancer dataset. It aids in early diagnosis and can help improve patient outcomes. 🏥❤️

## Features ✨

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling 🔧  
- Logistic Regression model for binary classification 🎯  
- Flask web app for user-friendly input and prediction 🌐🖥️  
- Instant prediction results based on user input 📝⚡  

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- Python 🐍  
- scikit-learn 🔍  
- Flask 🚀  
- HTML & CSS 🎨  

## How to Run 💻

1. Clone the repository 📥 
   git clone https://github.com/suhanakesharwani/breast-cancer-detection.git
   cd breast-cancer-detection

2. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask app for prediction UI:
    python app.py

4. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the app 🖱️

## Future Improvements 🚀

- Integrate more advanced models like Random Forests, SVM, or deep learning for improved accuracy.
- Add support for real-time data input and live predictions.
- Enhance the Flask web app with better UI/UX and mobile responsiveness.
- Implement detailed explanation and visualization of model predictions (e.g., SHAP or LIME).
- Extend the dataset with more features and larger, diverse patient data.
